This project has no purpose of its own, it's merely used to pull in
all of the unmanaged Mogre dependencies so that they don't clutter up
the projects you're actively working in.

Simply add a reference to this project in any other project that uses
mogre and the dependencies will automatically be copied into the output
directory of the referencing project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRO tip:

If you don't want to have a useless 'MogreDependencies.dll' sitting
around in your final build, you can invert the dependency: reference
your main game executable project from the MogreDependencies project.

You can then pick up the complete build in the bin directory of this
project and delete MogreDependencies.dll.


Personally, I'd just rename MogreDependencies to MogreHelper or something
and use it to collect common Mogre helper code I write. I like to keep
my build process as vanilla and stupid as possible ;-)
